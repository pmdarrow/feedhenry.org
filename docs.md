Documentation for FeedHenry is currently hosted on Red Hat's
[customer portal](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-mobile-application-platform-hosted/).

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-warning">
  <h4>Note!</h4>
  Currently FeedHenry's documentation is closed-source and geared more towards
  Red Hat's customers and not the wider open source community. We are aware of
  this problem and are currently working on a fix. Please stay tuned to our
  [blog]({{ "/blog/" | relative_url }}) for updates on this issue.
